            <h2 class="accordion-header">What is GetPly?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                GetPly is Language Mastery Software (LMS) – innovative platform that allows any native speaker to create
                and sell unique online courses for any language, level or topic. You might even be so cheeky (we are!)
                as to call it “crowdcoursing.” The resulting collection of language mastery courses becomes a
                marketplace where students can find the courses that best fit their personality and learning goals.

            <h2 class="accordion-header">What is Language Mastery Software?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                The ultimate goal – the whole point – of completing a language course is to become fluent. Why is
                this a big deal to us? Because most language students will never achieve fluency. They become
                caught up in completing assignments or reading a textbook instead of doing the activities that
                actually lead to language fluency.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps most damaging to a student’s potential is the popular lie that fluency can be achieved
                with just a few minutes’ practice each day.
                <br><br>
                Even some of the most intelligent and dedicated students won’t become fluent in a second language
                if they aren’t given the right tools to succeed. Most training courses, whether they are designed
                to teach Spanish or needlepoint, focus on one type of approach, such as flashcards, multimedia,
                audio and so on. Each of them can take you a long way, but none of them alone will help you make
                the final leap to fluency. For that, it takes a more skilful, well-rounded approach to course creation.
                <br><br>
                We at GetPly have developed a new kind of software – Language Mastery Software, or LMS, that is
                based on a combination of several methodologies, from flashcards and audio to games and oral
                drills. The software is based on the latest practical applications from master teachers,
                cognitive neuroscience and psychology of learning.
                <br><br>
                It takes real time and genuine dedication to master a language...but here’s
                the good news: The GetPly method is as simple as it is effective. You will spend your
                time learning in the most effective way possible...and you will have fun doing it!
                <br>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-header">How is GetPly different from other software and apps?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                Services like Duolingo, Babbel, Busuu, Rocket Languages, Rosetta Stone, Fluenz and hundreds of others
                are great! In fact, they are all so good we can’t tell them apart.
                <br><br>
                They have exactly one course for each of the most popular languages. One-size-fits-all,
                take it or leave it.
                <br><br>
                Another problem with any other app or software is that exotic language pairs aren’t represented
                at all. For example, if you’re a native Ukrainian interesting in learning French, you would
                have to learn English first. From time to time you’ll encounter Latin American Spanish as well
                as Castilian Spanish, but what about Catalan, Galician or Basque? Or 250+ languages and
                dialects spoken in Ghana?
                Or if you speak Urdu and want to learn Afrikaans? Well, good luck!
                <br><br>
                By contrast, GetPly is a platform that allows native speakers to create unique courses for any
                language pair or dialect, for students of any age and any level. In fact, there is no limit
                to what you can create and find in GetPly’s marketplace:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical Arabic for Swedish doctors</li>
                    <li>Romantic French for lovers</li>
                    <li>Pashtun for CIA field agents</li>
                    <li>Russian mafia slang</li>
                    <li>Chinese for Persian businessmen</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The only limit is human imagination which we believe has no limit.
                <br>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-header">How is GetPly different from other e-learning platforms?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                E-learning platforms like Teachable, Coursera, Udemy and hundreds of others all blur into one. They do
                one thing, and one thing only: replicate the classroom experience. These sites allow you to view text,
                videos and audio files from anywhere so you don’t need to commute – or
                even put on pants – to take a class.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, the e-learning technology didn’t live up to its promise. These platforms became
                glorified information products, based more on the publishing business model than anything else. The
                reality of this failure is reflected in the commoditization of the courses such sites offer and their
                falling prices.
                <br><br>
                Language mastery is not about receiving the material. You can get the pertinent information from a
                book or from an online class – there isn’t a difference. Language mastery is about spending hours of
                time one-on-one with a language, drilling, practicing and repeating the material.
                <br><br>
                GetPly courses use a set of tools that let you practice until the knowledge becomes automatic. And,
                you can practice anywhere. At the computer, on your phone, while walking, running, doing laundry,
                driving, waiting at the bus stop, sitting in the coffee shop or between classes.
                <br><br>
                In terms of course creation, GetPly takes the guesswork and long hours out of putting together
                learning materials. Anyone with creativity and the motivation to share their knowledge can
                build a language mastery course simply by following our step-by-step formula.

            <h2 class="accordion-header">How is GetPly different from 1-on-1 teaching exchanges?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                There is no shortage of student-teacher connection services, including Italki, HelloTalk and Tutor.com,
                plus a large number of teacher directories for Skype lessons. These are essentially offering online
                versions of a traditional – and antiquated – approach. The problem is that it doesn’t work. If it did,
                then everyone on planet Earth would speak two, three or more languages.
                <br><br>
                Language mastery takes more than conversation and coaching. We all know students who take classes for
                months and years and aren’t getting any closer to fluency than when they started.
                <br><br>
                For many students, taking classes or working with a language tutor becomes a form of procrastination.
                These lessons fill your need to work towards a goal, but they can be awkward to fit into a busy schedule
                and in the long run, they won’t make you fluent.
                <br><br>
                When you learn with GetPly, you can practice for a few minutes at a time and before you know it, a few
                minutes here and there add up to hours of valuable practice – without giving up any of your
                other priorities.

            <h2 class="accordion-header">How can GetPly help me as a student?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                In virtually every learning scenario, students are given course materials and expected to absorb them.
                This works okay for some, but not for everybody, and certainly not well enough to achieve language
                mastery. The problem is, how does the information actually find a home inside the student’s brain?
                That’s where cognitive neuroscience and learning research comes in - and at GetPly we’ve taken the
                science to heart to create language mastery experiences that make sense for the human brain. Learn
                more quickly, more easily and have much more to show for it when you are finished!

            <div class="accordion-content">
                Teachers working in traditional roles in schools or as tutors are trading time for dollars.
                If you are an educator, you know that when you finish the school day, your income is put on pause.
                In contrast, when you create a course with GetPly, you are leveraging your knowledge in exchange for
                a source of constant, passive income. GetPly language mastery software lets you create a unique and
                valuable course and sell it in our online marketplace, even as you sleep.

            <h2 class="accordion-header">How can I use GetPly at my language school?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                Classes are a great place to get to know your students, become aware of their personal challenges in
                mastering a language and track their progress. GetPly can boost the learning experience of those
                students by having them participate in language drills and exercises that you created. Instead of
                handing out endless worksheets and vocabulary lists, create your own specialized GetPly course and
                give your students the login.
                <br><br>
                In place of intrusive homework, you’ll be giving students the ability to learn on the go, whether
                they are relaxing after school, on a work break or waiting for dinner to arrive.
                <br><br>
                You can think of the additional resource as being your own learning method, but supercharged! Word
                of your unique approach and great results will get around, resulting in a fantastic enrollment boost
                that you can take all the credit for.

            <h2 class="accordion-header">Who can develop the GetPly courses?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                The short answer is, people just like you. If you are a creative and driven person, you can create
                unique courses in your native language and sell it to people around the globe, creating totally
                passive income. No specialized teaching or linguistic expertise is required. Thanks to our new
                and innovative method, there is no wrong way to create a course.
